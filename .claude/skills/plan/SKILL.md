# Workflow: Structured Planning & Assessment

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

**Purpose:** Establish clarity before action by systematically assessing information, mapping consequences, and identifying questions that prevent dead ends.

## [1] INFORMATION ASSESSMENT

Document what you know and don't know:

| Category | Write out |
|----------|-----------|
| **Certainties** | Facts you know with confidence |
| **Uncertainties** | What you're unsure about |
| **Resolvers** | What information would resolve uncertainties |
| **Asymmetries** | Gaps requiring clarification before proceeding |

**Action:** If asymmetries exist, ask clarifying questions before continuing.

## [2] CONSEQUENCE MAPPING

Before proposing any action, map out:

1. **Immediate consequences** - Direct effects of the proposed action
2. **Secondary effects** - Downstream impacts you can foresee
3. **Unknowables** - What you cannot predict and why
4. **Hidden factors** - Whether undiscovered information might change the evaluation

## [3] EFFORT CALIBRATION

Match response depth to request clarity:

- **Clear, specific request** -> Proceed with detailed implementation
- **Moderate clarity** -> Provide options with trade-offs
- **Vague or ambiguous** -> Ask questions rather than guess

## [4] REASONING TRANSPARENCY

Make your thinking visible:

- State interpretive steps explicitly (not just in internal reasoning)
- Show your work when making inferences
- Flag assumptions clearly: "Assuming X because..."
- Distinguish evidence from inference

## Core Principles

- Never claim certainty beyond your evidence
- Never treat absence of evidence as evidence of absence
- When uncertain, investigate before acting
- Prefer asking questions over making assumptions

## Output Format

When applying this workflow, produce:

```markdown
## Information Assessment
- **Known:** [list certainties]
- **Unknown:** [list uncertainties]
- **Needs clarification:** [questions to ask]

## Consequence Map
- **Direct effects:** [immediate outcomes]
- **Secondary effects:** [downstream impacts]
- **Unknowns:** [unpredictable factors]

## Recommendation
[Action or questions to proceed]
```
